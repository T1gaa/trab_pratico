### Introduction
For this assignment, two datasets were created (Table 2), each representing the extraction of radiomic features from
distinct brain regions: the hippocampus and the occipital lobe. The hippocampus dataset (DShippo) was selected due to
its significant relevance in Alzheimer's research, while the occipital lobe dataset (DSocc) serves as a control, as this region
is not typically associated with dementia. The hypothesis is that radiomic features in the postulated region of interest
will demonstrate differences that will consequently support delineating patients with MCI that will evolve to AD and
those who won’t.
### Delivery Due Dates:
* 27 de Novembro - 1º checkpoint
* 21 de Janeiro - Entrega final
### Delivery and Assessment
The results obtained should be the subject of a report, limited to 20 pages, which presents, among other things:
* The areas to be tackled, the objectives and how it is proposed to achieve them;
* The methodology used and how it was applied;
* Detailed description and exploration of both datasets and any processing carried out;
* Description of the models developed, what their characteristics are, how and on what parameters the model
was tuned, training characteristics, among other details that should be provided;
* Summary of the results obtained and their critical analysis;
* Presentation of suggestions and recommendations after analysing the results obtained and the models
developed.
